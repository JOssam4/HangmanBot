This is an Azure echobot that plays hangman with the user. It's still in development, so it hasn't (yet) been exported to any platform
outside the emulator.

What it currently does:
Asks the user if they want to play hangman (yes/no). If yes, then it plays hangman! If no, it bugs out. Oh well.

Future steps: 
- make it stop bugging out
- Add difficulty modes (evil hangman, kind hangman)
- make the code neater and more efficient
- export it to another platform (like slack)
